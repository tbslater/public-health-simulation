Hey, I'm Tom! Thanks for checking out my blog!

I'll be covering all things public health and simulation on this platform, so keep an eye out for some exciting posts. In the meantime, have a read of what is already out!

Just a bit of background on me! I am a PhD student at University of Exeter, officially settled in the department of Mathematics and Statistics. My work looks at a hybrid system dynamics and agent-based approach to address inequalities in physical activity interventions. So although on paper I'm a statistician, I have begun to branch out into the fields of data science, OR, public health and policy analysis too. And I hope to cover all areas (at some point) in this blog.

If you'd like to get in tough, feel free to drop me an email at [tbs204\@exeter.ac.uk](mailto:tbs204@exeter.ac.uk){.email} or reach out on LinkedIn.

Hope you enjoy the blog!

Tom
